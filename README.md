    -  [IHMPC](https://github.com/tssdantas/Process_Control_Portfolio/tree/main/IHMPC) An algorithm in MATLAB was built from scratch to implement an Infinite Horizon Model Predictive Controller (IHMPC) presented in the P1 problem of the paper "Odloak, D., 2004. Extended robust model predictive control. AIChE Journal, 50(8), pp.1824-1836.". The main features of this linear controller with restrictions are: 1) It's based on space-state model in velocity form, hence its offset free. 2) Recursive Feasibility: once a feasible input sequence is computed its guaranteed that subsequent optimization computations will remain feasible 3) Convergence propoerties: The control law obtained in the solution of the optimization problem will always drive the outputs to its reference signal. 4) Formal Proof Stability was presented in paper, hence the stability of the closed loop system is not dependent on tunning parameters 5) Large domain of attraction due to softing of the constraints with slack variables. Simulation with a MIMO Transfer Function model is presented.
    - [DMC](https://github.com/tssdantas/Process_Control_Portfolio/tree/main/DMC) An algorithm in MATLAB was build from the ground up to implement a classic model predictive control approach known as Dynamic Matrix Control. It is based on a linear multi-input multi-output (MIMO) step-response based space-state model. This approach was proposed by Cutler and Remaker, 1980, in the article "Dynamic matrix control â€“ a computer control algorithm". This code computes the optimum control sequence for the case where the process doesn't have restrictions.
